# A very basic running app
## Summary
My aim is to solve all my running related problems that Strava and other apps will not solve. At least not for free.

## Current features
- Displaying current 1000m split pace in minutes

## Planned features
- Reading out the pace in set time intervals
- Able to track intervall trainings
  - time, set and distance settings as well
  - and in combinations to (eg.: 2kms of 2 minute blocks (e.g.: 1:30min slow, 0:30min fast))
  - Others that come up in mind
